# Web Apps Opener

Type a link and press the button (or just hit Enter) to open any link in a frameless window  
You must write the protocol  

Similarly to [Add a shortcut to a website as an app](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/3060053) I needed a way to rapidly open links in a frameless window  
I use it with [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) hosted on google cloud platform  

If you find it useful just use it!
